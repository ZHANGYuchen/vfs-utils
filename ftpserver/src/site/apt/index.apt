VFS FTPServer Bridge

 Welcome to the VFS FTPServer Bridge homepage.

 This project provides an Apache Commons VFS implementation for the Apache 
 FTPServer project. Instead of working only on local files, with this VFS
 bridge you can connect to any VFS provider. You can still use a local file
 system, but you can also use a ZIP file, loop through to another FTP server,
 or use any other available VFS implementation such as DctmVFS.

 This bridge provides both read and write access to your VFS using the
 FTP protocol. 
 
 For the Apache FTPServer two services were implemented based on VFS; a 
 File System Manager that delegates to the VFS Provider and a User Manager 
 that allows the authentication to be based on the VFS Provider too.

 It is possible to only use the VFS File System Manager and to handle the 
 authentication using the standard Apache FTP Server mechanisms which support
 LDAP, a user database or a properties file with encrypted passwords. 
 
 Note that if the user passes this first station of authentication the VFS 
 provider still has to allow access to the user too!
 
 With this setup it is easy to restrict access to a certain group of users or to
 provide authentication if your VFS Provider does not have the ability to do so.
 
 If you want to let your VFS Provider handle authentication directly you should
 use the VFS User Manager. It authenticates the user via the VFS provider by
 accessing the configured root. 
 
 To use this bridge you should just add the VFS libraries, the VFS FTP Server 
 library and, if needed, your custom VFS Provider and its dependencies to the 
 common/lib directory of your Apache FTP Server installation.
 
 See {{{configuration.html}the configuration page}} for more information about
 configuring the VFS bridge.
 
 Note that the current version of the FTPServer needs Java 5. If you are using 
 Java 1.4 you can use the implementation found at 
 {{{http://dctmvfs.sourceforge.net/ftpserver-vfs/index.html}Dctm VFS}}. The 
 configuration is described 
 {{{http://dctmvfs.sourceforge.net/ftpserver-vfs/configuration.html} there too}}.
