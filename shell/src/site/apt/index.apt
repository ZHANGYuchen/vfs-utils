VFS Shell

 This project provides a Java Shell interface (or Java Command Line) .
 
 The shell interface is inspired on the Shell example that comes with the Apache Commons VFS library but it is more extensible and adds more functionality.
 
 It is easy to add commands or to change the behaviour of the existing commands.
 
 Make sure to check out the integration with {{{http://jline.sourceforge.net}JLine}} using the {{{../jline/index.html}VFS JLine Shell}}.
 It adds tab completion for commands and file names and does password masking on the open command. This makes the Shell a whole lot
 more professional.
 
 The command style is *nix like.

 The available commands are:

 * open: opens a filesystem and asks for username / password
 
 * close: closes a filesystem
 
 * cd, pushd, popd, peekd, dirs: directory manipulation
 
 * ls: directory content listing
 
 * cp, mv, mkdir, rmdir, rm: basic file manipulations
 
 * attrs:  meta data (attribute) manipulation (get, set, info)
 
 * ops: operation interaction (list, do, usage)
 
 * cat: dumps the content of a file
 
 * touch: resets the modification date 
 
 * error: details of last occurred error
 
 * set: sets variables
 
 * load: executes a file containing shell instructions
 
 * bsh: executes a beanshell script file or expression
 
 * rem: does nothing
 
 * echo: writes output
 
 * assert: verifies a file exists
 
 * register: registers a script as a command
 
 * help: displays the list of commands

 See the {{{commands.html} list of available commands}} for more details.
 
 Clearly this list can be extended with all kind of other commands. 
 
 Whitespace can be escaped using a backslash, e.g. cd Program\\ Files, but also using single or double quotes: 'Program Files' or "Program Files". If you're lazy you can also skip the closing quote, e.g. cd "Program Files.
 
 To exit the shell you can use exit, quit or bye.
 
 The variables are resolved before tokenizing and interpretation of the line which means you can also create a variable for commands and create macro-like structures.
 
 The beanshell interpreter has access to all variables but can not change them. Note that the beanshell interpreter accesses them without the $ sign.
 
 Example code:
 
+-----+
 cd '/Program Files
 pushd file:///c:/temp
 
 open vfsshell-dev.zip
 cp vfshshell-dev file://C:/Program\ Files
 popd
 cd vfsshell-dev
 
 set myvar file:///c:/temp
 bsh print(myvar);
 
 cd $myvar

 load myscript.vfs
+-----+

 You can load files containing commands as a scripting facility. The scripts are interpreted within the current context unless you specify the -c flag for the load command. Interesting for script files is the use of # for comments. You can also use the rem command for comments in the script. 
 
TTD
 
 * Support for wildcards in cp, mv and other operations
 
 * Piping of output to files
 
 * A java command to run any Java application
 
 * Sync command, Tranform command etc.
