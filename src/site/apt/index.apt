VFS Utils

 Welcome to the VFS Utils Project homepage.

 This project aims to offer a number of tools for the Apache Commons Virtual File System framework.
 
 If you are a developer you can use the VFS API in your code directly. If not, you'll 
 need some kind of user interface. 
 
 On this site you can find a module that will allow you to use the 
 {{{http://mina.apache.org/ftpserver.html}Apache FTPServer}} as an interface. 
 This module provides a VFS based implementation of two modules of Apache FTPServer, 
 the user manager 
 and the file system manager. With this you can use the Apache FTPServer
 to connect to any VFS Provider, including the Dctm VFS Provider. See the
 {{{ftpserver/index.html} VFS FTPServer homepage}} for more information.
 
 You can also find here the {{{shell/index.html}VFS Shell command line tool}}. This provides you with 
 a command shell that works on top of the VFS. It is based on the Shell example of Apache Commons VFS 
 but is more modular and extensible and has some additional features such as pushd, popd, attribute and 
 operation commands.
 
 Additional VFSutilities can be found in the {{{utils/index.html}Utils project}}.
 
Other VFS clients

 Another front-end you can use is {{{http://jcommander.sourceforge.net/}JCommander}}, 
 a Java based file manager that uses the Apache VFS layer. 

 Apache VFS is also supported by other tools, for example by two open source ESB 
 implementations, {{{http://mule.mulesource.org}Mule}} 
 and {{{http://servicemix.apache.org} Apache ServiceMix}}. 
 
 Hopefully the number
 of tools will further increase in the future.
 
 This project is hosted at {{{http://sourceforge.net}SourceForge}}.

Stability

 The libraries on which the project depends are still changing. 
 This does not mean it isn't usable, but rather that it will
 adapt to changes in new versions.
 
 The version of Apache Commons VFS that is used is the 2.0 SNAPSHOT.
