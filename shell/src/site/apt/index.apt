VFS Shell

 This project provides a Java Shell interface (or Java Command Line Interface) using VFS.
 
 The shell interface is inspired on the Shell example that comes with the Apache Commons VFS 
 library but it is more extensible and adds more functionality.
 
 Its first intent is being a file system manipulation shell, not a Java application launcher.
 
 It is easy to add commands or to change the behaviour of the existing commands. From within 
 the shell you have access to the engine to set variables and dynamically add new commands
 and use scripts. 
 
 You can setup the environment using scripts that are loaded when the shell starts, see 
 {{{configuration.html} Configuration}}.
 
 Make sure to check out the integration with {{{http://jline.sourceforge.net}JLine}} using the
 {{{./jline.html}VFS JLine Shell}}.
 It adds tab completion for commands and file names and does password masking on the open command. 
 This makes the Shell a whole lot more professional.
 
 The command style is *nix like.

 The available commands are:

 * open: opens a filesystem and asks for username / password
 
 * close: closes a filesystem
 
 * cd, pushd, popd, peekd, dirs: directory manipulation
 
 * ls: directory content listing
 
 * cp, mv, mkdir, rmdir, rm: basic file manipulations
 
 * sync: synchronize two directories
 
 * attrs:  meta data (attribute) manipulation (get, set, info)
 
 * ops: operation interaction (list, do, usage)
 
 * cat: dumps the content of a file
 
 * touch: resets the modification date 
 
 * error: details of last occurred error
 
 * set: sets variables
 
 * load: executes a file containing shell instructions
 
 * bsh: executes a beanshell script file or expression
  
 * register: registers a new class or script as a command
 
 * md5: calculates and compares md5 checksums
 
 * hash: calculates Java hash codes
 
 * rem: does nothing
 
 * echo: writes output
 
 * assert: verifies a file exists
 
 * sysinfo: shows information about threads, memory and system properties 
 
 * help: displays the list of commands

 To exit the shell you can use exit, quit or bye.
 
 See the {{{./commands.html} list of available commands}} for more details.
 
 Clearly this list can be extended with all kind of other commands. 
 
 The arguments passing is somewhat standardized. Normal arguments are given separated by whitespace. 
 Flags exist in two flavours, short flags and long flags. Short flags have one character and can be 
 combined in a single argument: -ef passes the flags e and f. Long flags are multi-character flags,
 e.g. --delete. They should be used when the flag has a big impact or when there are no short flags
 left. Options are key value pairs; e.g. --format=json. The pattern '-format json' is not 
 supported; it will be interpreted as a bunch of flags and one argument. The order of the arguments
 is only guaranteed for normal arguments; 'do a b c -def --ghij --klm=nop' is equal to 
 'do --klm=nop a --ghij -f b -ed c'. 
 
 Whitespace can be escaped using a backslash, e.g. cd Program\\ Files, but also using single or 
 double quotes: 'Program Files' or "Program Files". If you're lazy you can also skip the closing 
 quote, e.g. cd "Program Files. Multi-line input is possible when you end the line with a single 
 backslash ('\').
 
 The variables in the input are resolved before tokenizing and interpretation of the line which 
 means you can also create a variable for a command and create macro-like structures, 
 e.g. set x="cd /tmp".
 
 Currently you can not chain commands, nor pipe them or do things in the background.
 
 There is no bash-like control flow logic. If you want to script you can use Beanshell scripts you
 can load 'vfs' scripts with sequences of shell commands.

 The VFS scripts are interpreted within 
 the current context unless you specify the -c flag, which will create a new context. In the 
 scripts you can use # for comments. The scripts have access to all environment variables and the 
 arguments passed to the script. 
 
 The Beanshell interpreter also has access to all variables. Note that the Beanshell interpreter 
 accesses them without the $ sign.
 
 Example VFS Shell code:
 
+-----+
 cd '/Program Files
 pushd file:///c:/temp
 
 open vfsshell-dev.zip
 cp vfsshell-dev file://C:/Program\ Files
 
 attrs info vfsshell.dev
 
 popd
 cd vfsshell-dev
 
 open -p dctm://dmadmin@MyDocbase/System
 ops do dump Sysadmin
 attrs get r_object_id Sysadmin
 
 set myvar=file:///c:/temp
 echo $myvar
 set curdir=$cwd
 
 bsh -e print(myvar);
 bsh myscript.bsh
 
 cd $myvar

 load myscript.vfs

TTD
 
 * Correct usage of wildcards; currently only relative downward search is supported, you can not go
   up or provide absolute paths
 
 * Support for wildcards in mv and some other commands
 
 * Piping of output to files, chaining commands
 
 * Remote shell based on RMI or Mina
 
 * Starting commands in the background
 
 * A java command to run any Java application (Though you can already do this using the 'bsh -e' command)
 
 * Dynamic classpath extension (so you can load a jar from any VFS provider)
 
 * Additional commands: tranform, grep, tail, ...
 
 * Starting and managing other processes: ps, kill, ...
 
 * Some default scripts: Purge empty folders, ...
 
 * Scoping of commands to VFS provider schemes
 
 * A solution for man pages

Other Shells

  I didn't go very, very far in studying different Shell/CLI implementations. There don't seem to be
  that many general purpose Java shells available. 
  The VFS Shell is primarily based on the VFS Shell Example and the Beanshell CLI.
  
  The following projects are of particular interest:

 * Beanshell: More than just a CLI, it provides the interactive interface to the Beanshell Interpreter
 
 * VFS Shell example: Part of VFS, very basic shell to demonstrate VFS capabilities
 
 * Felix shell: Part of Felix, Apache OSGi
 
 * Sshd: Apache Mina SSH Server, a remote Shell
 
 * GShell: Part of Apache Geronimo
